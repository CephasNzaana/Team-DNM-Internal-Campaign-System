  // 1. Gather voter data based on filters
  // 2. Process support levels and interaction history
  // 3. Generate summary of support patterns
  
  const voters = await getVotersByFilters(locationFilter, demographicFilter);
  
  const supportDistribution = calculateSupportDistribution(voters);
  const recentTrends = calculateRecentInteractions(voters);
  const geographicSummary = summarizeByLocation(voters);

üîí Security & Best Practices
Security Implementation
Role-based access control with detailed permissions
Data encryption for sensitive information
Input validation and sanitization
Protection against common web vulnerabilities
Regular security audits and updates
Two-factor authentication for sensitive access
Error Handling
const handleApiError = (error: unknown) => {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'An unexpected error occurred';
  
  // Log error for debugging
  console.error('API operation failed:', error);
  
  // Determine user-friendly message based on error type
  let userMessage = 'Unable to complete the operation. Please try again.';
  if (errorMessage.includes('authentication')) {
    userMessage = 'Your session has expired. Please log in again.';
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('permission')) {
    userMessage = 'You do not have permission to perform this action.';
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('network')) {
    userMessage = 'Network connection issue. Please check your internet connection.';
  }
  
  return {
    message: userMessage,
    technical: errorMessage,
    status: 'error'
  };
};

Performance Considerations
Implement efficient database indexing
Use pagination for large data sets
Implement caching for frequently accessed data
Optimize image assets for mobile connections
Use lazy loading for non-critical components
Support offline operations in rural areas with poor connectivity
Responsive Design
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  mobile: '320px',
  tablet: '768px',
  desktop: '1024px',
  largeDesktop: '1440px'
};


// Tailwind classes example
const RESPONSIVE_CLASSES = {
  container: 'w-full px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-12 mx-auto',
  card: 'p-4 md:p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-lightGray',
  grid: 'grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4 md:gap-6',
  button: 'px-4 py-2 md:px-6 md:py-3 rounded-md font-medium'
};
